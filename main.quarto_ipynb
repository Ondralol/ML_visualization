        "\n",
        "Although K-Nearest Neigbours (KNN) is often regarded as very simple machine learning algorithm, its utility and power are undeniable. It is one of the core algorithms for supervised learning. Simply put, supervised learning is proccess of creating model that can predict value of target variable based on input data, using knowledge from dataset where we know the actual values of the target variables. KNN can be effectively used for both classification (target variable can take a limited number of values)  and regression (target variable can take on continuous range of values) tasks. The simplest explanation of KNN for classification tasks is that an object is classifed by plurality vote of its _k_ nearest neighbours. For regression tasks, KNN can be generalized so that an object is assigned value that is the average of the values of its _k_ nearest neigbours. However, this is just a basic overview and there are several factors to consider when using KNN to develop an effective machine learning model.\n",
